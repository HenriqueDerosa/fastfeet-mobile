# What is the briefing

The main goal of these three repositories was to create a whole application from the backend, mobile and web frontend.
Here is the briefing:

â†’ Part 4 [Mobile](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-10/)

# App responsibility

The mobile version of this application is for deliverymen use. They are able to mark their orders as _withdrawn_ or _delivered_. Also sending a photo as a receipt that the recipient has received the delivery.

# Conclusion for React Native version

Mobile Applications have never been one of my strong interests, however as it is very useful and helps to turn ideas into products, I will dedicate my time to learn more and improve my knowledge in this field.
Using React as a Native version for Mobile devices was a really nice technology to work with. I am really surprised on how easy it is to make something beautiful and useful.

As an actual conclusion I would say, regarding mobile development with React Native, I have to learn more about:

```
[reactotron, redux-saga, redux-persist, mobile storage]
```
